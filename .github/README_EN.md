## Important Notes

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are using an antivirus software other than Windows Defender, you may need to manually add rules to allow the executable files named "Program Files\SplitWire-Turkey\res\byedpi\ciadpi.exe" and "Program Files\SplitWire-Turkey\res\proxifyre\ProxiFyre.exe" in the firewall of the relevant antivirus software. For Windows Defender, firewall rules are added automatically, you don't need to do any extra operations. **If the antivirus software you use does not have its own network firewall feature or if you are not using an antivirus software other than Windows Defender, you can ignore this warning.**

> [!NOTE]
> Since the use of WinDivert files is blocked by the antivirus software named Kaspersky, you cannot use the GoodbyeDPI and Zapret tabs while Kaspersky is installed on your system. After completely removing Kaspersky from your system, download the **[SplitWire-Turkey Setup](https://github.com/cagritaskn/SplitWire-Turkey/releases/download/1.5.4/SplitWire-Turkey-Setup-Windows-1.5.4.exe)** file and perform installation again, these tabs will become active. You can also try to solve this problem by adding C:\Program Files\SplitWire-Turkey and C:\Users\-Username-\AppData\Local\SplitWire-Turkey folders to Kaspersky exceptions and downloading and installing SplitWire-Turkey again.

> [!NOTE]
> If you experience problems with WinDivert files in SplitWire-Turkey v1.5 and later versions for any reason, you can download and use the old version from [SplitWire-Turkey Release 1.0.0](https://github.com/cagritaskn/SplitWire-Turkey/releases/tag/1.0.0).

## Possible Problems and Error Reporting
- "Register failed"/"Config file not found" error: Some internet providers or CloudFlare itself may block the use of its free API for various reasons. The most common reason for this is regional overuse abuse defined as "abusive usage". For this reason, wgcf cannot register and create a configuration file, and as a result, the "Register operation failed. Return code: 1" error is received. In such a case, unfortunately, the Standard Installation, Alternative Installation and Custom Installation methods cannot fulfill their function and the necessary configuration file cannot be created. Even if this ban can be bypassed temporarily using a VPN or proxy; the private-key and configuration file created temporarily tunneled from the Cloudflare API will only be valid for the tunneled machine, so it will still prevent usage. If you get this error, you can try using other methods.

- Error during service installations: Do not use this application while the Services window is open.

- Getting stuck on "Checking for updates" screen: Turn off your modem, wait 15-30 seconds, then restart it. Then restart your computer and test whether the problem is resolved. If it is not resolved, run SplitWire-Turkey, open the Repair tab and click the Repair Discord button. After restarting your computer, check if the problem is resolved. If you still can't get results, run SplitWire-Turkey, open the Repair tab and click the Install Discord PTB button, then after the installation is complete, run Discord PTB via Start > Discord PTB and check if the problem is resolved.

- Getting stuck on "Starting..." screen: Run SplitWire-Turkey, open the Repair tab and click the Repair Discord button. After restarting your computer, check if the problem is resolved. If you still can't get results, run SplitWire-Turkey, open the Repair tab and click the Install Discord PTB button, then after the installation is complete, run Discord PTB via Start > Discord PTB and check if the problem is resolved. If your problem is still not resolved, right-click on Update.exe in C:\Users\-Username-\AppData\Local\Discord\ location, select Properties, go to the Compatibility tab in the opened window, check the "Compatibility mode for this program:" box, select Windows 8, then click Apply and OK buttons, restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved. If your problem is still not resolved, apply the same step as before, but this time check the "Compatibility mode for this program:" box and select Windows 7, then click Apply and OK buttons, restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved.

- Discord "Messages could not be loaded" error: This problem occurs when Discord itself detects suspicious IP changes or when Cloudflare WARP detects abuse. If you experience this problem, turn off your modem, wait 15-30 seconds, then restart it. Then restart your computer and test whether the problem is resolved. If you still can't reach a solution this way, you can try resetting the Discord cache by deleting the C:\Users\-Username-\AppData\Roaming\discord folder. (This method will log you out of your Discord account, you will be asked to log in again) If you still can't reach a solution this way, try other methods.

- Creating error reports: You can go to the [SplitWire-Turkey Issues page](https://github.com/cagritaskn/SplitWire-Turkey/issues) and click the **New Issue** button in the top right, and report by adding the .log files in the AppData\Local\SplitWire-Turkey\Logs folder to your report. You can open the Logs folder using the Open Logs Folder button at the bottom of the About page of the SplitWire-Turkey program.

## Virus & SmartScreen Warning
Since the program is open source, you can view and examine all the code. The entire program is open source and the source code can be examined in the /src folder and recompiled if desired. Users who do not want to use the program and do not trust it are not obliged to use the program, using the program is at the user's discretion.
If you wish, you can scan the entire folder, installation file, .zip file or source codes on a site like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) and examine the results, or if you know C# or have an acquaintance who knows it, you can consult to understand what the code is trying to do.

> [!NOTE]
> **SmartScreen "Windows protected your personal computer"** warning appears before running all unsigned software. The reason for this is that software must be subject to international code signing certificates. However, since this signing process requires regular payment based on the exchange rate and I am an independent developer who does not earn income, I cannot attempt to sign the software.

> [!NOTE]
> **[SplitWire-Turkey Setup file VirusTotal results](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/NmQxYTlhOTMyZDhhY2JlOGU0ZDRkOTkxNjIyMDEzMmI6MTc1ODA2MDE2NQ==)** False positive virus or malware reports detected by antivirus software used by a small segment of users may be detected in the files, but these are software with unreliable detection methods. The reason for detection is that SplitWire-Turkey installs multiple applications from a single program and makes many changes on the system. (DNS changes, service and program package installation, removal, etc.) I recommend reading the notes given below for your concerns about Kaspersky.

> [!NOTE]

The reason for detection is that SplitWire-Turkey installs multiple applications from a single program and makes many changes on the system. (DNS changes, service and program package installation, removal, etc.) I recommend reading the notes given below for your concerns about Kaspersky.

> [!NOTE]
> **WinDivert** files are detected as RiskTool by Kaspersky and a few antivirus software. As can be understood from the warning name **not-a-virus:HEUR:RiskTool.Multi.WinDivert.gen**, these files are; **not a virus**, it says it is a tool that can be harmful when used with files downloaded from wrong sources. Since SplitWire-Turkey and all its plugins are open source, you can track and understand how the WinDivert library is used. If you look at the detection descriptions, you can see the word NotAVirus. This detection type is defined as a risk tool because the open source WinDivert library used by GoodbyeDPI and Zapret manipulates network packets on Windows. This library is open source and can be accessed from [WinDivert Github](https://github.com/basil00/WinDivert). Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of both Russian and Turkish software developers, Kaspersky, which is pro-Russian government, and a few antivirus software companies together with it did not accept the reports and objections, so you cannot run methods using WinDivert if the relevant antivirus software is installed on your system. You can remove Kaspersky and other false positive antivirus software from your system and perform installation again to run WinDivert methods, or you can download and use the old version without WinDivert from [SplitWire-Turkey Release 1.0.0](https://github.com/cagritaskn/SplitWire-Turkey/releases/tag/1.0.0).

> [!NOTE]
> **Not-a-virus warnings generally mean that an application can be misused when preferred.**
The not-a-virus:HEUR:RiskTool.Multi.WinDivertTool warning is such a warning.
WinDivert library is an open source library for manipulating network packets on Windows operating systems. This library gains functionality with various software. GoodbyeDPI is one of them. GoodbyeDPI's purpose in using the WinDivert library is to prevent the service provider from examining correctly by making small changes in network packets.
However, software that can use WinDivert for malicious purposes can also be written. For example, software that performs phishing, MITM attacks or recording/sending user inputs by completely changing packets can be prepared. **However, this does not make the WinDivert library malicious. The software that uses the WinDivert library for malicious purposes makes it malicious.**
The antivirus software named Kaspersky, whether right or wrong, warns about this, but the main issue comes from its submission to the pressures of the Russian government. As you know, there is an internet freedom restriction in Russia. The government puts pressure on companies under its roof to block bypass methods as much as possible. The company named Kaspersky does not resist these pressures and accepts them. It tries to prevent methods that help bypass in many ways.
**In short, as long as you download from the right source, SplitWire-Turkey cannot harm your computer. Every time you download, first look at the address bar and pay attention to the URL. Download and use SplitWire-Turkey only from [this page](https://github.com/cagritaskn/SplitWire-Turkey/releases/).**

## How It Works

- Standard, Alternative and Custom Installation
First, a profile file is created with wgcf and this profile file is used with the WireSock client and split tunneling is started only for Discord.

- ByeDPI Split Tunneling and ByeDPI DLL Installation
First, the ByeDPI service is installed and in the ST method, this proxy is run for selected applications using ProxiFyre, in the DLL method, drover files ensure that Discord uses the proxy started by ByeDPI on localhost with automatic DLL injection.

- Zapret Automatic Installation
Finds ideal parameters for your system and internet provider using blockcheck technology and provides service installation by combining these parameters with your preferences. Scan speed selection adjusts how simple or deep the parameter scan will be.

- Zapret Preset Installation and One-time
Zapret service is installed or run once with predetermined ready settings (or edited versions if you made edits).

- GoodbyeDPI Service Installation and One-time
GoodbyeDPI service is installed or run once with predetermined ready settings (or edited versions if you made edits). If the Use blacklist option is active, bypass is applied only for domains in the blacklist. (By default, it is set for Roblox, Discord and Wattpad)

- Remove All Services
The bypass services installed by SplitWire-Turkey or by the user are listed and all are removed in the correct order. After this operation, no bypass method remains on your system.

- Revert DNS and DoH Settings
Before any installation you make in SplitWire-Turkey, all services are cleaned for clean installation, then Windows 11 supported DoH setting is activated and IPv4 and IPv6 DNS assignment is made (Google primary and Quad9 secondary DNS). (DoH activation is not supported for Windows 10 and below versions). The Revert DNS and DoH Settings button reverts these settings and returns DNS assignments to Automatic (DHCP) and closes DoH in Windows 11. (DoH is not activated for Windows 10 and below versions anyway)

- Remove SplitWire-Turkey
This button performs all cleanup operations and runs the unins000.exe removal package. When the operations started with this button are completed, SplitWire-Turkey becomes as if it was never installed on your system before.
